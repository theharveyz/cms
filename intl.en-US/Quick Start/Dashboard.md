# Dashboard {#concept_kfq_5nv_tdb .concept}

CloudMonitor dashboards are customizable pages that can be used to monitor data from multiple products and instances in all one area.

## View a dashboard {#section_fqv_sqv_tdb .section}

You can quickly view the resources used by each cloud product on its corresponding dashboard.

5.  On the displayed page, add charts as needed.

## Add a monitoring chart {#section_xzb_rwv_tdb .section}

You can add major cloud product metrics and your service metrics to the dashboard.

If you use multiple cloud products for your application, you can add the cloud product metrics to the same dashboard by adding a chart, so that you can view the global cloud product monitoring data.

When you report your service monitoring data by using the CloudMonitor API, you can add a chart to display the monitoring data.

**Procedure**

For details, see [Add charts](../../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Visual reports/Use dashboards/Add charts.md#).

-   Monitoring data cannot be restored after you delete it.
